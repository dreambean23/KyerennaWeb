 <p> For this final project I chose an issue that is close to my heart, but also shaped who I am. The issue I am referring to is homelessness and housing insecurity amoungst LGBT youth, this is a topic i know all too well because I was apart of that statistic from the age of 18 to 21. I am going to walk you through my experience, then we're going to get into some statistics, and to end our discussion I will provide you with some resources that may help anyone you know facing housing instability and homelessness. </p>
