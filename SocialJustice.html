    <title>What To Expect From This Conversation</title>

 <p> For this final project I chose an issue that is close to my heart, but also shaped who I am. The issue I am referring to is homelessness and housing insecurity amoungst LGBT youth, this is a topic i know all too well because I was apart of that statistic from the age of 18 to 21. I am going to walk you through my experience, then we're going to get into some statistics, and to end our discussion I will provide you with some resources that may help anyone you know facing housing instability and homelessness. </p>

<p> This first picture is of me and my girlfriend when we were 18 years old, we met at the same Independent Living Home called Mercy Center. It was essentially a smaller slightly better shelter for youths without children ages 16-21, I was one of eight girls there we had to work, figure out public trnasportation, and follow the rules of the house in order to stay there. It was one of many shelters that I would live in, however it was the best one. Through this shelter I was able to connect with other unhoused LGBT youth, for the first time I felt safe and at peace. Although my time there wasn't as long as I'd hoped so I sucked it up and I asked my mother to live with her again even thhough I knew I was goingback into a toxic household. Unfortunately that arrangement didn't last very long either, my mother is Roman Catholic and extremely homophobic so even though at the time I was out as Bi-Sexual at home I was in the closet. Over the course of a few months me and my best friend started developing deeper feelings for each other and I ended up coming out for a second time as a lesbian to everyone except my mother. Since we were both having trouble at home I started sneaking my girlfriend into my house so that we could be together. That quickly backfired when my mom suddenly knocked at my bedroom door for the first time in months, I scrambled to hide my my girlfriend in the closet before opening the door but it didn't work. I was forced to come out of the closet when my girlfriend was found in mine, my mother was furious and her anger was getting close to violence. That was the night I was disowned I was told I no longer have a mother; it was gut wrenching but I wasn't surprised so yet again I found myself homeless again at 19 only this time I had to go to DSS shelters that were riddled with bedbugs and all the women I lived with very extremely dangerous. Even though me and my girlfriend don't regret living our truth, our lives were put in danger countless times and our education was set back over half a decade just because we loved each other. The amount of queer youth I've met with similar stories is stagerring, we were children forced into unimaginabley hard and sometimes dangerous situations with little to no help from family or government resurces.  </p>
