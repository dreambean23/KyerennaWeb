<h1>About Ren</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Ren, I'm 26 years old, non-binary pronouns they/them, and currently a student at BMCC. My major is Liberal Arts with an interest in computer science and Engineering. I am also a member of National Success and Leadrship Society known as NSLS, I am a Guinea pig mother of two, and I am always working on something creative. While getting my education I've been working as a barista when I am not in class, I will be graduating either December 2024 or May 2025 depending upon my acceptence into the Kaplan Leadership Program. I have definately come into my own during my time at BMCC and have discovered a genuine love of learning! I took and excelled in so many different classes that it became difficult to settle on just one major, which is why I will be transferring as a double major. I also intend to earn a PhD in Computer Science as well as Enngineering. Outside of school and work I spend my time with my girlfriend of seven years, watching anime, gaming, creating, going out on adventures, or just relaxing at home. </p>
