<h1>My Work</h1>
<h2>My Raster Image</h2>
    <img src="images/Kyerenna_raster600px.jpg" alt="selfie composition" width="600px">
    <p>This image is inspired by little things that make up very big parts of me. Lets start with the background of the photo, Smithspoint beach on Long Island. It's one of my favorite places in the world I grew up going here. Being that I'm from Long Island, it's a testiment to my visceral need to be near a body of water at all times. The music notes represent how much music means to me, not only am I musically inclined from instruments to dance but both sides of my family are as well. Without music as an outlet I don't know what I'd do and that's how in earned a spot in my photo. Lastly is the sky, as pretty as it looks there is a deeper meaning. Those are the lesbian pride colors, I came out as a lesbian socially and to some family members when I was 19 and again at 20 to my mother which didn't go very well. Through everything living in my truth has truly saved my life in ways I can't begin to describe. Those colors mean so much to myself as well as millions of others before me but when I look at them I get filled with happiness, pride, and memories that I've made since coming out as an individual and with my long term girlfriend. </p>
    <h2>My Vector Image</h2>
    <img src="images/Kyerenna_VectorAvatar600px.png" alt="my avatar" width="600px">
    <p>My avatar is simple and fun. The stars in my eyes represent my uncanny ability to manifest things in my life. Whatever I see that I want I always end up getting whether it be through hard work, happenstance, or a combination of the two. Next the clouds represent something pretty obvious I'm a dreamer for sure. I always seem to have my head in the clouds but for the most part it's in a good way. The color purple in my background is just a pretty touch I added because it's my favorite color and he teal color is a close second. That is how I created my avatar! </p>
    
    <h2>My Audio Assignment</h2>

</audio>
<p>
    This audio was inspired by the faeries voice in the movie Legend with Tom Cruise and Tim Curry, the story I made up on a whim but the voice I created was something I knew I was going to center the story around. It's a short clip about the land of the lost and curious. I wanted to set the tone for a dark fantasy and I believe I did just that.
